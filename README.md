# ROP-prediction
It uses other well logs to predict Rate of Penetration for this well log
Predicting Rate of Penetration(ROP) of a particular well at various depths with help of a Machine Learning model which is developed from different wells when  itâ€™s various properties as well as ROP at certain depths are already known
Firstly, predicting ROP can cause drilling        optimization because maximization of ROP can greatly reduce expensive drilling costs. 
Second, optimum ROP will also save time because if we are drilling at a lower penetration rate where ROP can certainly be increased then we are actually wasting our time which is equal to wastage of money.
Why not drill with more and more ROP then?
Because it can lead to bit wear in hard formations, while formation damage can be produced in soft formations due to higher ROP.
