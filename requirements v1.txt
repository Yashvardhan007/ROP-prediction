**The model training was done using Kaggle Notebook with GPU accelerator**

"main-f-train-v1.ipynb" file has been consolidated to train the model as well as the prediction run is also done in the "Test file prediciton" section for the open test file.

"main-f-test-v1.ipynb" file used to predict the ROP for any file using the model. "weight model f v1.pkl" file will be necessary to be on session storage to use this file. 

"weight model f v1.pkl" file contains the weights of the model."main-f-train-v1.ipynb" file was used to build this file.

"test_file_f_pe_v1.csv" file contains the final predicted ROP on open test file."main-f-train-v1.ipynb" or "weight model f v1.pkl" files can be used to build this file on open test data provided.
